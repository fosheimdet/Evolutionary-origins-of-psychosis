On Mania and Depression
-------------------------

Let's assume the group forms a semi-static image of each of its members, subject to adjustment/updates over time. 

This image has a (significant) effect on the reproductive success of the individual, and so it is advantageous for the individual to 


a) Increase the surface area to the group during good times (Mania) 

b) Decrease it during bad times (Depression) 


Both a) and b) help form and maintain the best image possible
